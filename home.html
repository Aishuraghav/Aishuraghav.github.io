    	<p> <strong><h2><center>"Working out from home solves the most common excuse<br> people give for not exercising: a lack of time."</center></h2></strong> </p>
        <p>It’s a misconception that you need to go to the gym or spend thousands of dollars on equipment to get a good workout. Thousands of my 28ers have achieved fantastic results working out in the comfort of their own home using little to no equipment at all. </p>

<p>I’m a big believer in working out at home because, let’s face it, finding time to go to the gym isn’t always easy. In fact, getting to the gym can be tricky and downright stressful. The problems start as soon as you look for class times that fit into your schedule, then you have to get through all the traffic and then, hopefully, find a carpark that’s in the same suburb as your gym! Home workouts do away with all the stress and, once you understand what you need to do (and how simple it can be), you’ll be free to get fit whenever and wherever you want.</p><br>
